# splits
 SPecies' LImits by Threshold Statistics

"splits" contains tools for delimiting species and automated taxonomy at multiple levels of biological organization (eg. DNA barcoding, morphometrics), both top-down (merging phylogenetic and phylogeographic methods) and bottom-up (single samples into >1 groups).

I (finally) tweaked plot.gmyc() to be plot_gmyc() to avoid S3/S4 issues.
